1.0a (bugfix 1): 30.07.2001
---------------------------
Bugs fixed:
	- genericPDBFile: assigned incorrect element if the element columns did not
    contain a valid element symbol
  - FileSystem: canonizePath expanded ../../ to .., thus leading to problems with
    relative paths for in File and derived classes (PDBFile, HINFile, etc.)
  - APPLICATIONS/PB: Makefile used incorrect linker options correctly on Tru64
  - configure: did not abort if neither gethostname, nor sysinfo were found 
    (see unfixed bug below)
  - FragmentDB::AddHydrogensProcessor caused a core dump for residues where
    only one reference atom was available (e.g. water)

Known, but not fixed:
  - Expression does not evaluate all bracketed expressions correctly
  - configure causes some problems on Tru64 (fails to find gethostname)
    Workaround: in BALL/source type "touch config/configure.in;make configure" 
      and proceed as usual. The problem is probably somehow caused by some 
			incompatibility between certain autoconf versions and some Tru64 header
      header files, but I couldn't nail it down yet...

Added, changed: 
  - ResidueChecker: checks for overlapping atoms and duplicate atom names in a residue
  - Test for FileSystem
  - Python support functional (though still experimental, requires a patched version of SIP-2.5pre4, available
    from the BALL website). Recommended for seasoned Python veterans only.
  - BALL exceptions are know derived from std::exception
  - added fragment for Zinc (ZN.db)
  - The interface of GeneralException was slightly modified to achieve compatibility
    with the Python wrapper classes
  - The interface of RegularData2D::getMinValue/getMaxValue has changed
  - The interface of Object has changed (ever so slightly)
  - Changed the GridIndex typed of RegularData2D and RegularData3D (towards a more consistent IF)
  - The structure of ResidueChecker was modified to make way for a more modular design
    in the future
