1.0: 24.05.2004

Changed:
  - molview has been renamed to BALLView in order to avoid
    confusion (there are other applications out there with the name molview)
  - default constructor of FragmentDB does no longer open the default
    fragment database. If you want the same behavior as before, simply
    call FragmentDB::init() or use the other constructor with an empty
    string as an argument (e.g. 'FragmentDB db("");').

Added + improved:

    files
  - Documentation has been added and improved in numerous places

    use SHIFT, ALT, CTRL together with the mouse button

1.0pre1: 23.12.2002

  - PDB reader
  - visualization

Added + improved:

1.0b: 17.01.2002
----------------
Bugs fixed:
	- Lots of stuff in Expression, HINFile, PDBFile
  - some bugs in molview
  - FragmentDB::AddHydrogensProcessor was basically reimplemented
	- clean up of the NMR classes
  - AutoDeletable did not work correctly due to a strange problem with
    multiple inheritance 
  - too many to count everywhere else...

Added + improved:
  - first official support for the Python bindings (still experimental, though)
  - QSAR: a trivial framework for the implementation of molecular descriptors
  - File: allows the expansion of filenames to URLs (again)
  - MDL MOL files and SD files
  - SMILES parser (experimental)
  - several chapters in the tutorial
  - Solvent excluded surface should be *much* faster
  - AMBER force field got some speedup for partially selected structures

Known, but not yet fixed:
  - File and TCPTransfer occasionally show strange baehavior
    when retrieving files via the network
  - XDR support does not work under Tru64/cxx -- call configure with "--without-xdr"
  - String_test is really huge -- some compilers choke on it (internal stack overflow,
    cirtual memory exhausted) -- we can't do much about that...


1.0a BF1: 30.07.2001
--------------------
Bugs fixed:
	- genericPDBFile: assigned incorrect element if the element columns did not
    contain a valid element symbol
  - FileSystem: canonizePath expanded ../../ to .., thus leading to problems with
    relative paths for in File and derived classes (PDBFile, HINFile, etc.)
  - APPLICATIONS/PB: Makefile used incorrect linker options correctly on Tru64
  - configure: did not abort if neither gethostname, nor sysinfo were found 
    (see unfixed bug below)
  - FragmentDB::AddHydrogensProcessor caused a core dump for residues where
    only one reference atom was available (e.g. water)

Known, but not fixed:
  - Expression does not evaluate all bracketed expressions correctly
  - configure causes some problems on Tru64 (fails to find gethostname)
    Workaround: in BALL/source type "touch config/configure.in;make configure" 
      and proceed as usual. The problem is probably somehow caused by some 
			incompatibility between certain autoconf versions and some Tru64 header
      header files, but I couldn't nail it down yet...

Added, changed: 
  - ResidueChecker: checks for overlapping atoms and duplicate atom names in a residue
  - Test for FileSystem
  - Python support functional (though still experimental, requires a patched version of SIP-2.5pre4, available
    from the BALL website). Recommended for seasoned Python veterans only.
  - BALL exceptions are know derived from std::exception
  - added fragment for Zinc (ZN.db)
  - The interface of GeneralException was slightly modified to achieve compatibility
    with the Python wrapper classes
  - The interface of RegularData2D::getMinValue/getMaxValue has changed
  - The interface of Object has changed (ever so slightly)
  - Changed the GridIndex typed of RegularData2D and RegularData3D (towards a more consistent IF)
  - The structure of ResidueChecker was modified to make way for a more modular design
    in the future
 
Additional bugs:
  - no unknown bugs have been found
