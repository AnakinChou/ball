Description: The Biochemical Algorithms Library
 BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) is an application framework 
 in C++ that has been specifically designed for rapid software 
 development in Molecular Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology. 
 It provides an extensive set of data structures as well as classes 
 for Molecular Mechanics, advanced solvation methods, comparison and 
 analysis of protein structures, file import/export, and visualization.
 BALL is currently being developed in the groups of Oliver Kohlbacher
 (University of Tuebingen, Germany), Andreas Hildebrandt (Saarland 
 University, Saarbruecken, Germany), and Hans-Peter Lenhof (Saarland 
 University, Saarbruecken, Germany).

Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, python, libball-1.2
Description: A free molecular modeling and molecular graphics tool
 BALLView provides fast OpenGL-based visualization of molecular structures, 
 molecular mechanics methods (minimization, MD simulation using the 
 AMBER, CHARMM, and MMFF94 force fields), calculation and visualization 
 of electrostatic properties (FDPB) and molecular editing features.
