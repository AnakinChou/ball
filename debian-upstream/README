This directory contains all necessary means to create
a Debian package from a BALL git tree. It was created
by Andreas Hildebrandt from the BALL project team (upstream
author), based on earlier work by Andreas Moll,
and can be freely used by any downstream author
to do the packaging. The directory is named
debian-upstream to prevent any potential problems
between up- and downstream authors.

There are three different scripts in this folder:

createDebianSource:
Intended to create a Debian source package from git.
It does a git checkout, and creates a tarball.
To prevent unnecessary overhead for other platforms,
it also removes the Windows and MacOS folders and
afterwards creates a new tarball.
Finally, the package building process is started and
the following two scripts are run.

debian-ball-install:
Build script that may be reused for other platforms.

createBALLVIEWDEB:
It copies all relevant files like binaries, 
documentation, data files and so on into the folders
debian/{libball,libball-dev,ballview} for the packaging 
later on.
