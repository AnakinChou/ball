			On the right side you can see the structure of the C-ABL kinase domain in complex with Imatinib.
		 </p>
		 <p>		
			The ABL tyrosine kinase has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion, and stress response. Mutations in the ABL1 gene,  encoding the ABL tyrosine kinase, are associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

		 <p>
			Imatinib is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes, such as the ABL tyrosine kinase.

			Actually, Imatinib is a drug used to treat certain types of cancer. It is currently marketed by Novartis as Gleevec (USA) or Glivec (Europe/Australia/Latin America) as its mesylate salt, imatinib mesilate (INN). It is used in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and some other diseases. By 2011, Gleevec has been FDA approved to treat ten different cancers. In CML, the tyrosine kinase enzyme ABL is stuck in its activated form; imatinib binds to the site of tyrosine kinase activity, and prevents its activity.

			Imatinib is the first member of a new class of agents that act by specifically inhibiting a certain enzyme that is characteristic of a particular cancer cell, rather than non-specifically inhibiting and killing all rapidly dividing cells. Hence, it served as a model for other targeted therapy modalities through tyrosine kinase inhibition. 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for CML.[5] Imatinib has been shown to be more effective than the previous standard treatment. It is used in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other malignancies.
