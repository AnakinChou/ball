						<b>BALL</b> (Biochemical Algorithms Library) is an application framework in C++ that has been specifically designed
						for Computational Molecular Biology and Molecular Modeling. It provides an extensive set of data structures 
						as well as classes for Molecular Mechanics, advanced solvation methods, comparison and analysis of 
						protein structures, file import/export, and visualization.
					</p>
					<p>
						BALL has been carefully designed to be robust, easy to use, and open to extensions. Especially its extensibility, 
						which results from an object-oriented and generic programming approach, distinguishes it from other software packages. 
						BALL is well suited to serve as a public repository for reliable data structures and algorithms. The development of new 
						methods is greatly simplified when using the data structures and functionality provided by BALL.<br>
					</p>
					<p>	Based on BALL we have developed a stand-alone tool for molecular visualization, <b>BALLView</b>. BALLView makes the 
							broad functionality available through an integrated user-friendly GUI, on which you are actually looking. <br>
							The links below visualize prepared molecular modeling projects on the right window, so that 
							you are able to get a clue of BALL's and BALLView's functionality.
