<h2>3D Scene</h2>

The Scene widget provides the three-dimensional visualisation of the loaded molecules.<br>
All activated Representations are shown here.

<br>

<br><br>
The Scene has two distinct modes:
<ol>
  <li>Rotate Mode  (Hotkey CTRL-R)</li>
  <li>Picking Mode (Hotkey CTRL-P)</li>
</ol>
The user can switch between the two modes, either by pressing on the according menu entries in the menu point "Display",
or use the hotkeys.

<H3>Rotate Mode</H3>
In the Rotate Mode, the user can zoom, rotate or translate the view by pressing the mouse buttons and moving the mouse:
<br><br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" width=500>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width=50%>Button</td>
      <td>Effect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left</td>
      <td>Rotate left/right and up/down</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Middle</td>
      <td>Zoom in and out</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Right</td>
      <td>Translate up/down and left/right</td>
    </tr>	
  </tbody>
</table>

<br><br>
For user with less then three mouse buttons exist special combinations, so that BALLView works well also with one mouse button:

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" width=500>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td widht=50%>Mouse button + key pressed</td>
      <td>Effect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left</td>
      <td>Rotate left/right and up/down</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left + Shift</td>
      <td>Zoom in and out</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left + Control</td>
      <td>Translate up/down and left/right</td>
    </tr>	
  </tbody>
</table>

<H3>Picking Mode</H3>
The Picking Mode is designed to identify parts of molecules or mark them for special tasks. 
A special cursor occurs, an the user can either click on single items or moving the mouse button with 
pressed left or right mouse button to create a selection rectangle. Any picked objects become instantly colored 
(normaly yellow, see image on top). In the <a href="molecularControl.html">Molecular Control</a>, 
the checkboxes for the entries of these items become checked. The user can also deselect picked objects
by using the right button (or for users with only one mouse button, by using the left mouse button and the Shift-modifier).

<br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" width=500>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td widht=50%>Mouse button + key pressed</td>
      <td>Effect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left</td>
      <td>Select geometric objects, e.g. for atoms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Right (or Left + Shift)</td>
      <td>Deselect geometric objects</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<H3>Selection Color</H3>
The color for selected objects can be changed in the <a href="displayProperties.html">DisplayProperties dialog</a>.

<H3>Background Color</H3>
The background color can be changed in the Preferences under the point "3D View"->"Common".
