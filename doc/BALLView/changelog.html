          - several problems in Cartoon model<br>
          - creation of models for several selected items<br>
          - overall cleanup of RegularDataWidgets<br>
          - export of PNGs could result in strange problems e.g. with empty images<br>
          - its now possible to create transparent wireframe and dot models<br>
          - AtomDistanceColorProcessor<br>
