 <h2>Changes Since Version 1.0 (02.06.04):</h2>
1.1 mostly features changes related to the Python support, some bugfixes and
a large numer of prominent fixes and improvements in BALLView.
Most of these improvements are related to an improved user interface and some
new models and animation possibilities.<br>
<h4>Added:</h4>
  - Python support: added more classes to the Python SIP interface<bR>
	- new application: DCD2PNG to create series of PNG-images from a DCD trajectory file<bR>
  	- Documentation for BALLView in the folder BALL/doc/BALLView  <bR>
    - new models for rendering nucleic acids and for visualizing forces<bR>
  	- calculation of Ramachandran plots for proteins<bR>
		- improved ball and stick model now renders double-, triple- and aromatic bonds<bR>
		- ability to create animations, either as on-screen presentations or for movies<bR>
		- OpenGL rendering now allows for depth cueing, material paramters may be adjusted<bR>
  	- Stereo display using side-by-side mode or shutter glasses<bR>
  	- Clipping planes<bR>
  	- storing and loading of BALLView project files<bR>
  	- support for drag and drop of molecular files<bR>
		- possibility to highlight the selected molecular items<bR>
  	- new move mode for (partial) structures<bR>
  	- Esc key now switches to last used mode in Scene<bR>
  	- Python scripting:<bR>
  		- Hotkey support for starting any (BALL-)Python command from BALLView<bR>
	  	- support to quit program from Python interpreter<bR>
  		- support for starting Python script from command line<bR>
  		- Benchmark scripts for BALLView<bR>

<h4>Fixed:</h4>
  - CygWin support was temporarily broken<bR>
  - fixed the Python support to work with an official SIP release (4.1.1)  <bR>
	  - selection in MolecularControl with CTRL and SHIFT modifier<bR>
	  - several problems in Cartoon model<bR>
	  - creation of models for several selected items<bR>
	  - overall cleanup of RegularDataWidgets<bR>
  	- export of PNGs could result in strange problems e.g. with empty images<bR>
	  - its now possible to create transparent wireframe and dot models<bR>
  	- PeptideDialog: deletion of sequence in entry field<bR>
  	- increased performance of SnapShot visualisation, especially for large numbers of SnapShots<bR>
  	- A click on the "default" button in Preferences now only works on currently selected page<bR>
		- multiple loading of the same file will create enumerated names for the Systems<bR>
		- it was not possible to reset the by-element coloring scheme to the default values <bR>
		- issue with restoring window geometry on X11<bR>
		- MDS dialog: toggling export to trajectory file was broken<bR>
		- now show the correct number of bonds added when building bonds for a structure<bR>
		- ResidueIndexColorProcessor now no longer considers water residues <bR>
		- visualization of contour surfaces had sometimes incorrect normals<bR>
		- several core dumps related to missing mutex locks<bR>
		- memory management under Windows

<h4>Changed:</h4>
		- improved focus camera on molecular structures<bR>
	  - general improvements in the user interface<bR>
		- inside of surfaces is now correctly drawn<bR>
