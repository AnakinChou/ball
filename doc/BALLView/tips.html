<H2>General tips and hints for BALLView</H2>
This page gives hints for BALLView, which dont fit somewhere else...
<h3>View molecules in 3D stereo<a name="3D"></a></h3>
BALLView provides two different ways to view molecules in 3D: Stereo with shutter glasses and side-by-side stereo.
Both can be switched on in the menu entry "Display->Stereo".<p></p>
When BALLView is running in a 3D Stereo modus, users can change the eye distance of the both viewpoints by
using the cursor keys left and right. Left decreases the eye distance and right increases it. The Shift-modifier 
boosts the effect of the two keys.  The optimal eye distance varies for every person and view, so it must be adjusted manualy.
The amount of the eye distance can also be changed in the Preferences:<br><br>

The focal distance seems to have no effect on most viewers, so its settings may be removed for future releases of BALLView.<br><br>
<b>Caveat:</b> Since for 3D viewing two seperate images have to be created for every camera movement, the 3D performance 
can drop to half, while rotating or zooming the view. Consider buying a fast graphics accelerator card if you want use this feature.

<H4>Shutter glasses</H4>
To use shutter glasses with BALLView, you have to use a quad buffered graphics accelerator card.
This  has up to now only been tested with a NVIDIA Quadro card on windows.
But it should also work well with Linux and ATI Fire cards. If you make any experiences in this field with
BALLView, please let us know...

<H4>Side by side</H4>
For side by side stereo viewing the following hardware is needed: 
<ul>
	<li>two projectors with the same brightness, which project to the exactly same spot</li>
	<li>polarisation filters to fit on them</li>
	<li>special polarisation glasses</li>
	<li>a silver coated canvas</li>
</ul>
But this form of stereo projection does not require a specific type of graphics accelerator cards.

<h3>Visualise hydrogen bonds<a name="hydrogen_bonds"></a></h3>
To visualise hydrogen bonds, BALLView first has to calculate their position. This can be done, by highlighting a
System and clicking on the menu entry "Tools->Calculate H-bonds" (ALT-N). Then a new Representation for them has
to be created, while using the model "H-Bonds". The result could look like:<br>

<h3>Usage of the POV-RAY export<a name="POVRay"></a></h3>
<a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a> is an external rendering program which is freely available.
The POV-Ray files which were created by BALLView contain the command line, with which POV-Ray should be invoked to
render the image. This line could look like:
<pre>povray +Imy.pov +FN +Omy.pov.png +QR +W1037 +H922 -UV</pre>
To use antialiasing in POV-Ray, the flag "+A0.3" can be added.

<h3>Create animations<a name="animations"></a></h3>

<h3>Create movies from pictures<a name="movies"></a></h3>
To create movies from a set of images, we suggest useage of the GNU program <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/h">mencoder</a>, 
which is freely available for Linux, MacOS and Windows.
To create an AVI video with 25 frames per second from all PNG images in the current directory with the codec <a href="http://www.xvid.org/">XviD</a> and a bitrate of 1600 kbit/s invoke
<pre>mencoder  "mf://*.png"  -mf fps=25 -o output.avi -ovc xvid  -xvidencopts pass=1:bitrate=1600</pre>
