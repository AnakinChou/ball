<h2>GeometricControl</h2>
The GeometricControl enables the user to create and manage Representations.
A Representation is a set of geometric objects, which can be visualised in the 
<a href="scene.html">Scene</a>.<br><br>

The list view shows the name of the model, the name of the molecular entities, for which the
Representation was created, the coloring method. The numbers at the right are the number 
of molecular entities, which were used to create the Representation (here one System) and the 
number of geometric objects. All at the left side, there is a checkbox to switch the Representation on and off.
The GeometricControl has its own context menu:<br><br>

<H3>Coloring of surfaces</H3>
To color a surface, it has to be selected and the context menu entry "Color Surface" must be clicked. Then a new dialog appears.
BALLView provides two possibilities to color surfaces:<br>

<H4>Coloring by grids</H4>

Informations on how to create and manage data grids can be found <a href="datasetControl.html#data_grids">here</a>.<br>
At the top of the dialog, the user can select the grid, which he wants to use for coloring.
At every point of the surface, the value in the three-dimensional data grid is interpolated to a color,
which is then used to color the surface. The colors, which are used come next.
The min, mid and max colors are the colors between which is interpolated. They 
correspond to the values, between which is interpolated.
The min min and max max colors are used for points in the data grid, which are outside 
of this range.
If the autoscale button is pressed, the min, mid and max values are taken from the grid,
but the user can also change the values freely. The number of levels corresonds to the number of 
colors, which are used for interpolation. <br>
If the user wants to have a transparent surface, the must select "alpha-blending" at the lower left corner.
Then he can change the alpha values (opacity) for any color.
