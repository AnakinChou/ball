\section{BALL Strings}

BALL provides a heavy-weight string class that has been designed
to provide a wealth of functionality using a simple and consistent syntax.
In general, you should avoid using {\tt const char*} or STL string when using
BALL, although they are compatible to each other. You can easily convert BALL
strings to char pointers (using the {\tt c\_str()} method and automatically
convert char pointers to BALL strings.
