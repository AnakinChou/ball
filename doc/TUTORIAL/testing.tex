BALL provides an extensive suite of test programs to ensure the correctness of
the code on all platforms. This test suite requires a lot of patience since
the compilation takes quite some time. However, we recommend to run these
tests to ensure that the library is fully operational. At the moment, the test
suite does not yet cover all functionality of BALL, but only some chosen
classes.  The test programs are located in the directory {\tt
BALL/source/TEST}.  To compile and run the test suite, use "{\tt make test}".
Please make sure that {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} is correctly set, otherwise the
execution of the test programs will fail.

Each of the test programs tests one or more classes of BALL. When a test
program (\eg~{\tt Atom\_test}) is run, the program prints either "OK" (if all
tests passed) or "FAILED" if any of the tests failed. "{\tt make test}" runs
all tests and complains if a certain test fails.  If this happens, please let
us know by mailing the files specified in the output of "{\tt make test}" to
one of the developers - this helps us to improve the library.  The mail
address for bug reports is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{} \email{ball-bugs@mpi-sb.mpg.de}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
For all bug reports, please include your system configuration, the file
\file{config.log} (which contains the results of tests configure performed),
and the file \file{BALL/include/BALL/config.h} (which contains the compiler
defines used by BALL).
