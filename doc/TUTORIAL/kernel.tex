The BALL kernel data structures have been designed to model the problem 
domain (\ie well-known biochemical entities) as closely as possible.
Although some of the terms in biochemistry are rather fuzzy, there is a clear
hierarchical relationship (Fig.~\ref{figure:problem-domain}).
BALL tries to model this hierarchical relationship as a tree structure.
The design pattern used to implement this tree is the {\em composite
pattern}\cite{DesignPatterns}, which is implemented in the \class{Composite} class.
Derived from Composite are \class{AtomContainer}, the base class of all
classes handling atoms and \class{Atom}. As a typical user, you will probably
have to use only derived classes of \class{AtomContainer}, atoms, and bonds.
The kernel classes decompose into three frameworks: the general molecular
framework, the protein framework, and the nucleic acid framework
(Fig.~\ref{figure:kernel-frameworks})
Each of these frameworks contains a few classes which try to model the
respective problem domain as closely as possible. We will briefly discuss the
roles of each of these classes before describing some of the general features
of the kernel classes.

\paragraph{The molecular framework} contains the classes \class{System},
\class{Molecule}, \class{Fragment}, \class{Bond}, and \class{Atom}. 
Molecules can contain an arbitrary number of atoms or fragments. A fragment
can be used to define distinct groups in a molecule, \eg functional groups or
charge groups. Fragments can be nested, so you may want to define several
functional groups within one larger fragment in a molecule. The atoms are then
contained in the fragments. In contrast to other systems, the atoms of a
molecule are not necessarily connected to each other (or in graph-theoretical
terms: they do not have to represent a connected component of the graph
formed by atoms and bonds). Systems are nothing but collections of molecules.

\paragraph{The protein framework} is a specialization of the general molecular
framework and describes the structures encountered in proteins. Proteins are
(more or less) molecules, so \class{Protein} is a subclass of \class{Molecule}
and proteins can be handled like molecules and stored along with them in
systems. Proteins can often be decomposed into several chains. These chains in
turn can contain secondary structure elements, which then contain residues.
Residues usually describe the amino acids of a protein. The sequence
information of a protein is encoded implicitly in the order of the tree: it
can be obtained by reading all instances of \class{Residue} in the order they
are contained in a protein. So the protein, the chains, and secondary
structure elements should contain the residues in the correct order, from
N-terminal to C-terminal, if you construct them by hand. The first and last
residue of a chain are considered to be terminal (according to the member
function \member{Residue}{isTerminal}). This is also the reason why a protein
should always contain at least one chain. Secondary structure elements,
defined by \class{SecondaryStructure} are optional. Wherever this information
is known (\eg when read from PDB files), instances of
\class{SecondaryStructure} are created to store it. Each secondary structure
element contains a class {\eg helix, $\beta$-sheet) describing its type.

\paragraph{The nucleic acid framework} contains the classes \class{NucleicAcid}
and \class{Nucleotide} and is used to represent structures of nucleic acids.
Right now, we do not differentiate between DNA and RNA, so if you need these
classes, we are eager to get your input on how to model DNA and RNA in a more
detailed way -- currently do not have yet any application for it.

By deriving all kernel classes from the common base class \class{Composite},
they share all the features implemented there. The following section will
briefly discuss some of these features.

\paragraph{Iteration} over kernel data structures is a key concept in BALL.
The BALL kernel iterators a re STL-like iterators. Since most BALL kernel
classes are so-called {\em multi-containers}, \ie they can contain different
objects, we cannot use the typical STL {\tt begin()}/{\tt end()} methods.
For example in a protein, you might not only want to iterate over all chains,
but also over all residues or all atoms contained therein. So in BALL there
are the methods \member{System}{beginChain()}/
