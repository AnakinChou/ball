\label{section:kernel-data-structures}
The BALL foundation classes are a collection of useful classes used throughout
the whole BALL kernel. The following sections shall help you to get acquainted
with seom of the mor important ones. The foundation classes can be broken down
into several categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item general data structures (e.g. strings, portable data types, hash
			containers)
	\item concepts (e.g. management of properties, object persistence)
	\item mathematical data structures (e.g. vectors, matrices, geometric
				primitives)
	\item system classes (file I/O, networking, logging)
	\item miscellaneous other stuff
\end{itemize}
These classes implement a plethora of useful things, so you should just browse
through the reference manual to figure out which ones suit your needs. 

Some of the classes are of such importance that we will give a short overview
of their basics in the following sections, however the total number of classes
is just to large to cover here. Have a look at the headers in 
\directory{BALL/include/BALL/COMMON|CONCEPT|SYSTEM|MATHS|DATATYPE} -- it's
worth the time!
