<h3>Changing the camera position</h3>

For setting the lights and for finding a proper camera position for our picture efficient handling of the camera is needed.<br>
To change the camera's position click with a mouse button into the 3D graphics view and drag the mouse:
<ul>
<li> Left button: Rotate
<li> Middle or Wheel: Zoom
<li> Right button: Move view 
<li> Left and Right button: Rotate in the screen plane
</ul>
<br>
Try to zoom very close to the peptide and very far away and compare the brightness of the scene of both camera positions.
<br>

<br>
A roughly sensible camera position can be found by centering the camera on the entire peptide:
Find the widget with the name <b>Structures</b> and
highlight the System by clicking on its name ("ARND").<br>
Then press the right mouse button to open a context menu and press on the
<b>Focus</b> entry.
<br>
<br>
This will enable the next step of the tutorial.<br>
Press Next to continue.
