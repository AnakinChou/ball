<h3> Visualisation of trajectories </h3>

To visualise the resulting trajectory, we will have a look at the 
DatasetControl. It is one of the listviews in the main window and
has the caption "Datasets". 
(Maybe it is hidden, if you don't find it, have a look at the menu
 entry <b>"Windows->Datasets"</b>.)<br><br>
The DatasetControl should have an entry for the trajectory.
To visualize it, click on the entry and open the context menu with
the right mouse button and choose "<b>Visualise/Export</b>". 
In the "Snapshot Visualization" dialog press "<b>Animate</b>".
Feely free to watch the visualization for as long as you want, you can stop it, by pressing
the "Cancel" button. 
<br> 
Then close the visualization dialog by pressing the "<b>Close</b>" button.
