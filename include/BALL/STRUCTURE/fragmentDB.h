		/** AddHydrogensProcessor.
				The AddHydrogensProcessor adds missing hydrogen atoms to all residues its 
				started for. It uses a geometric calculation based on aminoacid prototypes 
				which are saved within the FragmentDataBase. For calculation several hashtables 
				are used: {\tt ini_table_}, {\tt h_table_}, and {\tt prot_table}. 
				{\tt ini_table} contains for every hydrogen the list of names of reference 
				atoms used to start calculation. 
				{\tt h_table} contains for every residue the list of names of hydrogens to be inserted. 
				{\tt prot_table} contains the set of atoms of all residues in order to access atoms by name.
				First, the actual residue is identified and its database template is stored in {\tt tmp}.
				Next, tmp is beeing searched for hydrogens to be inserted. Their names are saved in 
				{\tt h_atoms_} and this	entry is stored in {\tt h_table_} for further use.
				Now the actual residue's {\tt h_table} entry is iterated in order to insert the 
				missing hydrogens. At first a check is done , wether the actual hydrogen is inserted or not.
				If it is inserted the next hydrogen is checked. If it is not, try to acces {\tt ini_table} 
				entry of actual hydrogen in order to get names of reference atoms. If it is not accessable, 
				entry has to be built and saved for further use. Get the first reference atom by simply follow 
				the bound of template hydrogen. This atom is saved in {\tt atom_feld[0]}. Now start at atom in 
				{\tt atom_feld[0]} and check its bonds. If the next bond points to a non-hydrogen atom this 
				atom is stored within the next field of {\tt atom_feld}. If actual atom has no more bonds to	
				check, procedure continues with next field of {\tt atom_feld}. Procedure stops if 4 reference 
				atoms are found. These reference atoms are saved in {\tt ini_table_} under name of the 
				hydrogen now to be inserted. Now the coordinates of reference atoms have to be determined in 
				both coordinate systems. {\tt prot_table_} contains names of the template residue. 
				If {\tt prot_table} entry does not exist so far, it has to be built.	In order to do this a 
				function named {\tt addToTemplateTable} is called which saves every atom of template under its 
				name in {\tt prot_table}, so next time its atoms can be easily accessed through their names. 
				Finally the coordinates of reference atoms are saved in vector field {\tt xx}.
				Next the actual residue is searched for the reference atoms, simply by iterating through its atoms. 
				Their coordinates	are stored in vector field {\tt x}. The vector {\tt xtarget} contains position 
				of template hydrogen which has to be transferred into coordinate system of the actual residue.
				Bindungsatom contains the atom with which the inserted atom has to built a bound.
				With these informations the calculate function is called.
				It creates a new {\tt PDBAtom} which is added to the atom list of the current residue
				It creates a new bond between inserted hydrogen and passed {\tt Bindungsatom}.
				The passed template hydrogen is transferred from one coordinate system into another. 
				In order to do the right operations some calculation is done using the passed reference atoms. 
				The following operations are done with reference atoms of actual residue and the template residue. 
				Of course every operation calculated for one reference atom is done with any other reference atom 
				(e.g.: third point is turned the same angles as second point).
				At First, the first reference point is moved to the center in both coordinate systems. 
				After that, the second point is turned onto x1x2-plane and then its turned onto x1-axis. 
				In both coordinate systems the appropriate operations	are done to the other reference points. 
				The third point is then turned onto x1x2-plane. Mirror variables are set in order to get the third 
				point into first quadrant of x1x2-plane. Again appropriate operations are done to the other points 
				in both coordinate systems. See that third point operations are uneffected to first and second point. 
				The forth point is needed just to check whether it is necessary to set another mirror at x1x2-plane.
				Finally, the operations calculated for template residue coordinate system are executed for 
				{\tt x_target}, which is the reference hydrogen to be inserted. 
				After that, the operations calculated for actual residue coordinate system are executed backwards for 
				{\tt x_target}, to bring the hydrogen into the right position.
				At last, the new atom is assigned and bounded. The next hydrogen of residue can be processed. 
				If all hydrogens of actual residue are fitted, next residue can be processed.
