		This section contains some base classes used for creating model

		Model processors are responsible for creating the model representation.
		Model connectors are used by the model processors to connect
		different models to each other (e.g. connect a <it>ball and stick</it> model
		with a <it>line</it> model, etc.).
		Connector processors only create models for \link Bond Bond \endlink objects.
