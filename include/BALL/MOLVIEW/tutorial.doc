/** @name Tutorial.

		In this tutorial we discuss how to implement processors and to use them with a dialog
		to extend the functionality of an existing application.
		The dialog we create will be the same as the one in the \Ref{VIEW.} tutorial
	  (section \Ref{Construction of a dialog.}) with some additional
		implementations. But first we want to create a processor that performs a task.
