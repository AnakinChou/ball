/** @name Adding the dialog to the example application MOLVIEW.

		Now that we have a dialog for creating bounding boxes for molecular structures
		the only thing to be done is to include this dialog into an existing application.
		We use the example application created in the \Ref{MOLVIEW.} document.
		To add the dialog to the application we just create it with \Ref{MainControl}
		as parent. Add this line to the example application.

		\begin{verbatim}
      new TestDialog(&main);
		\end{verbatim}

		Now we have successfull added this dialog into our application. If we start the
		application now a new menu entry ({\em DISPLAY-TestDialog}) is available. If pressed our dialog opens and
		any selection done in the \Ref{MolecularControl} will be catched by our dialog. If we press
		the {\em apply} button for each molecular structure (except atoms) a bounding box
		will be created in the color displayed in the preferences tab widget. In the \Ref{MolecularControl}
		we can see each bounding box as an entry below the \Ref{System} with the name of
		the molecular structure the bounding box was created for.
		If we want to delete such a bounding box just press the right mouse button on it and
		choose {\em remove bounding box}, it will be deleted.\\ \\

		That concludes the tutorial for MOLVIEW. Now you are able to build your own
		processors and dialogs and thus extend or rewrite any functionality the actual
		example application lacks.
