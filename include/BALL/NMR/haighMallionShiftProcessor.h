				The actual ring's ringplane and it's area is calculated. 
				Iterating over every bond of the aromatic ring, the triangle areas are calculated with:
				The bond's two atoms and the actual proton's projection onto the ringplane.
				It is important to state that these areas are signed areas, depending on wether there is 
				a right handed system between the plane's normal vector and the difference vectors 
				from the projection	to the two bond's atoms.
				Next the protons distances to the actual two bond's atoms are calculated and stored 
				in a_first and a_second.
				Then ts is calculated : $ ts = f * (1/a_{first}^3 + 1/a_{second}) $ with f as the actual tringle area.
				For every bond of the ring this partial sum is calculated , added and stored in gs.
				Just some constant factor B and the chemical shift using Haigh Mallions Model is done.
				Important note:
				Distances are expressed in terms of the actual ring's diameter.
				Triangle areas are expressed in terms of the actual ring's area.
