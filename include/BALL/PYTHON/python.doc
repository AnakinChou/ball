/**@name	Python extensions
	BALL provides classes for the extension of \URL[Python]{http://www.python.org},
	an object oriented script language.
	Since the language concepts of C++ and Python are rather dissimilar, several	
	concepts had to be ported and modified. This chapter describes the BALL classes
	that implement these interface classes.
