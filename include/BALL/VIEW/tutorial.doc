/** @name Tutorial.

		This tutorial will show you how to implement geometric primitives and dialogs/widgets.
		In VIEW there are a number of predefined geometric primitives already available,
		e.g. \Ref{GLSphere}, \Ref{GLTube} etc. More often there is the case that a needed
		primitive is not available and therefore must be programmed anew. The first part
		of this tutorial will show how this is achieved. A new primitive, the cross, will
		be introduced.\\
		Another crucial step in implementing an application is the programming of
		dialogs or widgets, their interaction with the other widgets and the integration into
		the main application. In the second part we will discuss the creation of a dialog 
		that will have all the above properties.
