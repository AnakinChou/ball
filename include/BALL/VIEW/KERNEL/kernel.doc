                      With the help of the class {\em Client} it is possible
                      to transfer a \Ref{Composite} to a {\em VIEW} application with
                      a server. 
	                    The class {\em QTTimer} is a timer class that is necessary for the
	                    \Ref{Server} class. It queries every given interval whether new
                      data from the client is accessable and directs it to the {\em VIEW}
		                  application.
