/** \defgroup ViewKernelClient Client/Server request handling
		\ingroup ViewKernel
		With the help of the class <em>Client</em> it is possible
		to transfer a \link BALL::Composite Composite \endlink to a <em>VIEW</em> application with
		a Server. 
		The class <em>QTTimer</em> is a timer class that is necessary for the
		\link BALL::VIEW::Server Server \endlink class. It queries every given interval whether new
		data from the client is accessable and directs it to the <em>VIEW</em>
		application.

/**  \defgroup ViewKernelConnectivity Widget connectivity and message queuing
		 \ingroup ViewKernel
		 These classes are responsible that the widgets and dialogs
		 can communicate with each other. If a new widget or dialog
		 is created it must be derived from the class \link BALL::ConnectionObject ConnectionObject \endlink.
		 This class defines the interface and the properties needed to 
		 communicate with other widgets.
		 The class \link BALL::VIEW::Message Message \endlink and the various derived classes define
		 some useful messages for special events.
