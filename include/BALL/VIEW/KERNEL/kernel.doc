/** \defgroup ViewKernelClient Client request handling
		\ingroup ViewKernel
		With the help of the class <it>Client</it> it is possible
		to transfer a \link Composite Composite \endlink to a <it>VIEW</it> application with
		a server. 
		The class <it>QTTimer</it> is a timer class that is necessary for the
		\link Server Server \endlink class. It queries every given interval whether new
		data from the client is accessable and directs it to the <it>VIEW</it>
		application.

/**  \defgroup ViewKernelConnectivity Widget connectivity and message queuing
		 \ingroup ViewKernel
		 These classes are responsible that the widgets and dialogs
		 can communicate with each other. If a new widget or dialog
		 is created it must be derived from the class \link ConnectionObject ConnectionObject \endlink.
		 This class defines the interface and the properties needed to 
		 communicate with other widgets.
		 The class \link Message Message \endlink and the various derived classes define
		 some useful messages for special events.

/**  \defgroup ViewKernelGeometricPrimitives Geometric primitives creation (base classes)
		 \ingroup ViewKernel
		 These classes are the base classes for primitive creation.
		 The class \link GeometricObject GeometricObject \endlink is the most important base class
		 for all primitives. It contains the base properties and base
		 interface definition all primitives must have.
		 The other classes are additional property classes to extend
		 a primitive with extra properties.
