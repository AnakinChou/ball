/**	\defgroup View Rendering
		\ingroup Visualization
		The VIEW libary currently contains two methods for rendering 
		visualisations:<br> 
		The obviously most import is the OPENGL renderer which provides 
		hardware acceleration.
		It is used e.g. used in the Scene in the molview application.<br>
		In addition it is possible to export a representation into POVRay format.
		This enables high quality rendering of single images e.g. for high resolution
		images in publications. <br>
		If you want to add support for a new type of rendering, create a new derived 
		Renderer class.<br>
