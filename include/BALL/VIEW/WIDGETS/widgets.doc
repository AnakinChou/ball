/**	\defgroup View Widgets
		\ingroup Visualization
		To provide a high grade of encapsulation of functionality we have
		developed a design pattern of independent widgets, called ModularWidget.
		Some of the derived classes have to following abilities: <br>
		- Rendering of visualisations
		- Control of hierarchically data structures
		- Control of the representations
		- Control of trajectories
		- Logviews
		- Interface to the Python interpreter
		- Plotting of one and two dimensional data
		Other derived classes are easy to implement.
