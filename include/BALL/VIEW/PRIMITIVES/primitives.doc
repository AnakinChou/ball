/**	\defgroup ViewPrimitives Geometric Objects
		\ingroup Visualisation
			The representation of molecular structures consists of primitive geometric objects, e.g.:
			- Boxes
			- Discs
			- Labels
			- Lines
			- Meshs of triangles
			- Points
			- Spheres
			- Tubes
			- ...

			Every such object is implemented in a class derived from
			GeometricObject. It contains all the information for the Renderer classes,
			to show it on the screen or export it to specialised formats (e.g. POVRay).
			<br>
			If you want to visualise a new geometric object, create a new GeometricObject class
			and adapt the Renderer.
