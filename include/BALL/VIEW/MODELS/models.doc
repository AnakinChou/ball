/**	\defgroup ViewModels Model Processors
		\ingroup Visualisation
			There are several model types to visualise molecular structures in VIEW:<br>
			- Line
			- Stick / BallandStick
			- Surfaces
			- Backbone
			- Cartoon
			- VanDerWaals
			- ...
			<p>
			Every model is implemeted in a class derived from ModelProcessor, which operates 
			on Kernel objects (Atom, Bonds, ...). <br>

			If you want to add a new model, you have to do four things:
			- Create a new model processor class
			- Add a new entry in the enum VIEW::ModelTypes (see VIEW/KERNEL/common.h)
			- Insert the name for the new model in getModelName() (see VIEW/KERNEL/common.h)
			- Modify DisplayProperties::createRepresentation_()
			The new model will be automaticaly added to the DisplayProperties dialog. 
			<br>

			There are also several methods to colorize the molecular models and every method
			is implemented in a class derived from ColorProcessor. Every instance of 
			ModelProcessor has a pointer to an object of ColorProcessor, which it calls to
			get the color for the geometric objects.
