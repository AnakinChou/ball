/** \defgroup ViewPrimitives Predefined primitives (without graphical representation)
		\ingroup View
		In this section some predefined primitives can be found.
		They represent the primitives only in the sense of geometric 
		properties. The graphical visualization implementation is
		moved to the GUI/PRIMITIV section. In that section the primitives
		of this section are extended with the implementation of the
		graphical visualization of their geometric properties.
