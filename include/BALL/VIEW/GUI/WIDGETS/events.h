		/**	The Events class.
				The class Events declares some event classes, the appropriate receiver classes
				and event combination operators to handle, process and combine events.
				Macros are used to declare these classes.  The  \link Notification Notification \endlink  concept of
				BALL is used for the receivers classes. The class  \link Scene Scene \endlink  binds its own
				methods to the receivers classes of {\em *this} events. Further the  \link Scene Scene \endlink 
				object uses the combination operators to combine different events together and
				sent them to other receiving event classes prio registered with the 
				 \link Notification Notification \endlink  mechanism of BALL.
				The names of the methods may seems a bit too long and unreadable but they are only
				event names and will used and created automatically for the  \link Scene Scene \endlink  object.
