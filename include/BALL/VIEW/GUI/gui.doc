/**@name	Predefined primitives with graphical representation.
	        These classes are the extension of the primitives in the
          PRIMITIV section. These classes do not have any additional
          geometric properties but only the implementation of their graphical
					representation.
          For information concerning the geometric properties see the definition
          of the primitives in the PRIMITIV section.
