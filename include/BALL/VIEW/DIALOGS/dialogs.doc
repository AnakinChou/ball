/** \defgroup ViewDialogs QT Dialog Classes
		\ingroup Visualisation
		This section contains all dialogs, which are created with QT.
		All dialogs should be constructed with the QT designer and the 
		implementation has to be sourced out to a derived class.
		This has two goals:
		- Seperate the design of the dialogs from the implementation
		- Make the dialogs independent from a specific version of the QT libary
			(There are serious problems otherwise, because QT is inconsistent between
			 different version of the libary)
		<p>
		(This sound worse, than it is. Just have a look at a simple dialog 
		(e.g. SetCamera) and you will see its not that bad.)
