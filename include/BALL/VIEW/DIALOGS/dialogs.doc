/** \defgroup ViewDialogs QT Dialogs
		\ingroup Visualisation
		This section contains all dialogs, which are created with QT.
		All dialogs should be constructed with the QT designer and the 
		implementation has to be sourced out to a derived class.
		(This sound worse, than it is. Just have a look at a simple dialog 
		(e.g. SetCamera) and you will see its not that bad.)
		This outsourcing has two goals:
		- Seperate the design of the dialogs from the implementation. This accelerates
			the redesign of existing dialogs.
		- Make the dialogs independent from a specific version of the QT libary
			(Otherwise there are serious problems, because QT is inconsistent between
			 different versions of the libary.)
		<p>
		Some dialogs are derived from ModularWidget to participate in the sending and receiving
		of Message 's. The other dialogs have to be informed manualy, it something happend, that
		they need to know, e.g. to disable certain controls.
