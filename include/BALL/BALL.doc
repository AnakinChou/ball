			Rapid Software Prototyping can significantly reduce development times in the
			field of Computational Molecular Biology and Molecular Modeling. BALL
			(Biochemical Algorithms Library) is an application framework in C++ that has
			been specifically designed for this purpose. It provides an extensive set of
			data structures as well as classes for Molecular Mechanics, advanced
			solvation methods, comparison and analysis of protein structures, file
			import/export, and visualization. <p>
			
			BALL has been carefully designed to be
			robust, easy to use, and open to extensions. Especially its extensibility,
			which results from an object-oriented and generic programming approach,
			distinguishes it from other software packages. BALL is well suited to serve
			as a public repository for reliable data structures and algorithms.  The development
			of new methods is greatly simplified when using the data structures and 
			functionality provided by BALL.
