	/**	Auto-deletable concept.
			This class allows the distinction between objects that may be deleted
			automatically (because they are created dynamically on the heap) and
			instances that are static and should not be deleted automatically.\\
			Standard application is the class \Ref{Composite}. Composites may
			contain other composites (tree-like structure). If a composite is
			deleted, it has to decide whether all composites contained therein
			are to be deleted, too.  If these composites are static objects,
			calling their destructor often is fatal!  The same is true for
			objects contained in an array.  Therefore, composite is derived from
			\Ref{AutoDeletable}.\\
			The AutoDeletable class determines whether it was instantiated via
			{\bf new} and then sets an internal flag to false. The mechanism to
			determine this is as follows:\\
			AutoDeletable has on overloaded new operator. When invoked, this
			operator allocates storage for an instance of AutoDeletable using the
			global new operator and remembers the address of in a private
			variable {\bf last\_ptr\_}.  Each constructor of AutoDeletable checks
			whether its {\bf this} pointer is equal to the address stored in {\bf
			last\_ptr\_}. If both pointers are equal, the object has been created
			using the new operator and so it is safe to delete it automatically.
			If the adresses do not match, the object is either part of an array
			or static and should not be deleted automatically.\\
			The state of each object may be changed after it is constructed by a
			call to \Ref{setAutoDeletable}. This might be useful to protect
			certain instances of objects, however usually this should not be
			neccessary.\\
